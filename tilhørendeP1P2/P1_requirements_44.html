                <h3>About our client</h3>
                <p>Our client, Heidi Dalåmo, is a dentist from Trondheim, Norway. She was born and raised in Meråker, Norway, but did her studies in Stokholm, Sweden. 
                    She moved back to Norway in 2010 where she now works as a private dentist at Valentinlyst. 
                    She currently recieves appointment bookings via Valentinlystssenteret's website, which is something she would like to change as she works private. 
                    That is why we plan to make a website for her.</p>

                <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
                <p>The purpose of this website is to attract attention to Heidi's dental office and to make her services accessible to a broader customer group. 
                    Heidi has previously booked her customers through the Valentinlyst dental office, but now she wants her own website, which will allow her clients to contact her office directly. 
                    Heidi values the aesthetics of her workspace, and has chosen to go with a pink theme in her dental office, which is something we will include in the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to make Heidi's dental services more available, including having a functional and user friendly website that
                    provides her services to the customers in a comprehensible way. In order to do this we want to include different sections, 
                    such as a booking section, an about us-section, a list of treatments with the price listed and so on, so that it's easy for the user to navigate through the website.

            <section>
                <h3>Audience</h3>
                <p>Our website's main audience will be those who want to book an appointment with Heidi, through the booking section of the site. 
                    Heidi only does adult treatments, so this audience will consist of people over the age of 21. 
                    Additionally, those who wish to learn about the different treatments offered, research prices or contact the dental office, will also make up a part of the audience.

                    <li><b>Booking:</b>
                        In the menu, we want to include shortcuts to an appointment booking page. We have not decide how this page will be structured, but we want the customers to be able to send a message to the clinic to book a treatment.</li>
                    <li><b>Contact us:</b>
                        In this section, we want to present the contact information to the clinic. 
                        This includes a phone number, mail address, clinic address and different transport options to the clinic.</li>

                <h3>Final destination</h3>
                <p>When the project is finished, the client will decide if she wants to keep the website open for further use. 
                    If she decides to keep the site open, we will find a relevant domain name to keep it open on, i.e. tannlegeheididalaamo.no
