        <h1>Project Design</h1>
        <byline>By: Aurora, Eeman, Lana, Lotte, Klara and Helene <br>
            Date: 12. October 2023</byline>
        <div class="centered-div">
            <h3>Administrative details</h3>
            <p>Client name: Heidi Dalåmo <br>
                Role: private dentist </p>
            
            <hr>

            <h3>Purpose, goals and audience</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to attract attention to Heidi's dental office and to make her services accessible to a broader customer group. Heidi has previously booked her customers through the Valentinlyst dental office, but now she wants her own website, which will allow her clients to contact her office directly. Heidi values the aesthetics of her workspace, and has chosen to go with a pink theme in her dental office, which is something we will include in the website. 
                <br> <br>
                The goal of this project is to make Heidi's dental services more available, including having a functional and user friendly website that provides her services to the customers in a comprehensible way. In order to do this we want to include different sections, such as a booking section, an about us-section, a list of treatments with the price listed and so on, so that it's easy for the user to navigate through the website. 
                <br> <br>
                Our website's main audience will be those who want to book an appointment with Heidi, through the booking section of the site. Heidi only does adult treatments, so this audience will consist of people over the age of 21. Additionally, those who wish to learn about the different treatments offered, research prices or contact the dental office, will also make up a part of the audience.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Navigation structure</h3>
            <p>
                The front page of our website will be the homepage. The homepage will have a top navigation menu that provides access to all pages through links. The navigation menu will follow the page when you scroll down. There will be an additional button on every page linking to the booking page.
                <br> <br>
                The main menu should provide access to relevant submenus, such as the “treatments” page. The page is seperated into four categories, and the navigation menu will have a dropdown menu when you click on "treatments", linking to the different subheadings/sections on the page. We will aslo like to include a standard footer at the bottom of all pages which will include contact information and links to relevant information. 
            </p>
            
            <hr>

            <h3>Page layout and apperance</h3>
            <p>The goal of our styling is to introduce our customers to a clean and organized website, to influence them to visit the dental office in the near future. A good first impression increases the chance of happy customers and good reviews. </p>

            <p>The specific styling for the website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Font: PT Serif </li>
                <li>Color scheme: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text: black</li>
                        <li>Background: off-white rgba(255, 252, 254, 100)</li>
                        <li>Links: blue rgba(0, 0, 255, 100)</li>
                        <li>Shadows: we have decided to wait until we are further into the project, to see if we want shadows on the pictures.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Body width: 960px</li> 
                <li>Links: Valentinlyst tannlegekontor (https://valentinlysttannlegekontor.no/)</li>
                <li>Navbar position and its appearance: The navbar will be included at the top of the page, and follow the page when you scroll down. </li>
                <li>Banner: The banner will be “Heidi Dalåmo Tannlegeklinikk”, as seen in the mock-up picture. </li>
                <li>Footer: Logo, address and phone number. <br>
                Valentinlyst senter <br>
                Anders Estenstad veg 14 <br>
                7046 Trondheim <br>
                +47 739 11 313 </li>
            </ul> 
            <p>Logo: our logo will be located in the upper left corner. We have designed a logo for Heidi Dalåmo using favicon.io/logo-generator/. </p>

            <h3>Content</h3>
            <h4>Homepage - homepage.html</h4>
            <p>
                The homepage is the first page that appears when the user visits the website. 
                The goal for our homepage is to grab the users attention and make the user experience as easy and as clear as possible.
                In the middle of the homepage, there will be a large image of the dental office. The image will grab the users attention and give a preview of the content of Heidi's website. To make the homepage as simple as possible for the user, we want to minimize the text amount. Too much text will often overwhelm the audience, and can also be perceived as confusing. 
                <br> <br>
                The text in this page will firstly consist of a menu bar on top of the page, including the pages “about us”, “treatments”, “pictures”,”booking” and “contact us”. This menu bar will have a fixed position, making it available and visible at all times, when the users are visiting the different pages of the webpage. This will make it easy for the user to go from page to page and explore. Under the big picture in the middle of the page we will have two buttons with links to bookings and treatments. That's because we want these two pages to be the easiest to access, as they are the main reason people visit the website. 
                <br> <br>
                Under the picture, next to the two buttons for treatments and bookings, we will have a little section called “Why choose us?” to give the user reasons for why they should choose Heidi's dental care. This is to build our webpage's and service's credibility. Next to the little text-section “Why choose us” we will have a small picture of Heidi, so the user gets to see who their potential dentist is. On the bottom of the page we will have a footer with the logo and contact information such as the address and phone number, so the customer can contact us/Heidi if they have any questions. This section will have an absolute position.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/homepage-mockup.png" alt="homepage mockup">

            <h4>About us - about.html</h4>
            <p>
                The “about us” page will give a brief description and introduction of Heidi and her nurse and assistant at the dental office. This will include a brief description of each person, along with a picture of them. This is to show the user the people that works at the office, and will help give an even better introduction of the employees.
                <br> <br>
                There will be a booking button placed in the down right corner of the page. The booking-button will have the same placement on all the pages on our website besides the homepage. This is because we want the booking button to be available at all time, making it easier for the user to book an appointment. In the top left corner, there will be a "back to the frontpage"-button, so the user can easily get back to the homepage after visiting the “about us” page. This button will also be on every page of our website, just like the booking-button.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/aboutus-mockup.png" alt="about us mockup">

            <h4>Treatments - treatments.html</h4>
            <p>
                The “treatments” page should give the user a clear overview of the treatments available at this dental office. At the top of the page (below the menu bar), there will be a header with the text “treatments” to make it clear to the user that they are now on the treatments page. Below the header we want to have sub-headers of the different categories of treatments, which are: general dental treatments, Aesthetic treatments, complex treatments, and treatments for bite and dental position. 
                <br> <br>
                We want to group the treatments into these categories, so it will be easier for the user to find the treatment they are looking for. Under these sub-headers, we want to have a bullet point list of specific treatments and a price estimate for each treatment. This way, the user will have all the information they need about their desired treatment. 
            </p>
            <img src="./images/treatments-mockup.png" alt="treatments mockup">

            <h4>Prices - prices.html</h4>
            <p>
                The price page will give the user an overview of the prices on different operations. There will be a list with the prices in the center of the page. This list will help the users see the price of each single operation, as they can combine operations that are not necessarily a treatment in itself. This differs from the price estimate on the treatments-page, as the treatments often consist of multiple smaller operations. Under the price list, we will have a button linking to the treatment page. This way, the user can easily access all information about the treatments the office offers.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/prices-mockup.png" alt="prices mockup">

            <h4>Bookings - booking.html</h4>
            <p>
                On the booking page, there will be a digital fill-in form where the user can book an appointment by filling in information, such as first name, surname, address, e-mail, and phone number. The user van also choose a date and time for the appointment, along with which treatment they need or want. At the desired date section, there will be a calender-date-picker, to make it easier for the user to plan and pick a date for their appointment. At the treatment section, there will be a drop down treatment list with all the different treatments the office offers. 
                <br> <br>
                We will also have a little fill-in section for “other information”, in case the user needs to give information that's not included in any of the other fill-in sections. Lastly we will have an "accept terms and conditions"-button, before the user can submit their booking. Our goal is to make this form responsive and confirm to the user that their request has been recieved and is being processed. 
            </p>
            <img src="./images/booking-mockup.png" alt="bookings mockup">

            <h4>Contact us - contactus.html</h4>
            <p>
                On the “contact us” page, we want to provide the user with all information necessary for contacting the dental office. This information will consist of a phone number, an email, how to get to the office, and the full address. We also want to include a brief description of which bus routes the user can take to the dental office, and parking options.
            </p>
